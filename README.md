The primary goal of inventory management is to ensure materials are accessible whenever needed by the production department, preventing interruptions due to shortages. To achieve this, maintaining a buffer stock of critical items is essential for smooth operations.

I have developed this inventory management system to achieve these objectives. By providing precise inventory counts, the system facilitates timely order fulfillment and prevents confusion over stock levels. Additionally, ensuring an adequate supply of finished products not only meets customer demands but also bolsters the companyâ€™s brand reputation, demonstrating an effective solution to inventory challenges.
